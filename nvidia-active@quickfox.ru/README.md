# NVIDIA GPU active Icon
## How to install
Just clone this repository and copy the `nvidia-active@quickfox.ru/files/nvidia-active@quickfox.ru` folder to `~/.local/share/cinnamon/applets/` and restart Cinnamon (`ALT+F2` -> `r` does that!). The applet should now be available in the Applets panel. Add it!

## How to use
Look at the icon: colored - the GPU is active (not off), gray - the GPU is suspended

## Logs 
Logs are located in the looking glass, `ALT+F2` -> `lg` to access it.
